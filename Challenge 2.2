method called play() which prints "the player is playing ciricket.derive two classes,batsman and
bowler,from the player class.override the play() methord in each derived class to print"the batsman
is batting" and "the bowler is bowling", respectively. write a program to create objects of both the
batsman and bowler classes and call the play() methord for each object.'''
