'''
implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the 
list based on their CGPA (cumutative grade point average) in descending order.Each student object
has the fallowing attributes: name (string), roll_number (string),and cgpa (float), test the function
with different imput lists of students.
